### Define Users
Let's start by defining the users of Pet Battle. Here is one example. Meet: Nynaeve Almeara

### User Journey

Let's map a user journey based on the Nynaeve's interaction with the service. It helps us to understand her motivation and emotions while she is using the product. Ideally, user journeys help to investigate every side of the solution, and provide key pointers on how to design and improve a product or MVP. But in our case, it will help us to define what is good from the user point of view and map out the most important components for the given journey become successfull. These are essential to decide the most important SLIs. Having too many SLIs can cause distraction or unneccesary noise. When we have the best SLIs, we can identify the best place to collect data/metrics for the components and lastly, create a dashboard to display that to reflect our service quality.
