## Exercises

Exercises are created using [Docsify](https://docsify.js.org/#/). Write docs in Markdown and use [Docsify](https://github.com/QingWei-Li/docsify-cli) cli to serve them. Store your lab exercises in the `exercises/<lab-number>` dir.


To run and serve the docs:

1. `npm i -g docsify-cli`
2. `docsify serve exercises` and connect to `http://localhost:3000`
