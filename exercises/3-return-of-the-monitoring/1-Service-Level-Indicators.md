## SLIs
Service Level Indicators, or SLIs, is about having meaningful measurements of your service in terms of your user's perspective. They are closely tied to what the users of the service care about, such as availability, latency, or response time.


[TODO] for facilitators; create a persona and a journey map for the enablement and let people to discuss PetBattle from scratch ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”

<!---replace this with OPL practices

### Now a bit hands on
[TODO] research for drill down dashboard in Grafana
Let's install Grafana and visualize the SLIs we just decided.

how can we apply these practices into our training? Like, what would be an SLI for a trainer for this particular enablement?
99% of topics we aim for the day is delivered?
how can we measure if we are meeting our SLO?
think about setting the environment - was there any toil? did we have any incident (for cluster etc) during an enablement? how did we react? did we run a analysis?
or DO500 examples?
what could be a good incident for an enablement? loosing all slideS? :D 
Beta Runs - good example for testing?
number of people, logistics etc - capacity planning
Donâ€™t just teach the tech, teach the culture.--->
