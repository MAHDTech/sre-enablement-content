### ðŸŒ± Brand New SRE team!
The company sees this as an opportunity to explore Site Reliability Engineering practices and decides to form a team to provide operational excellence to PetBattle. But it is not just about managing apps in production. SRE practices and SRE mindset can (and will) help the company for future decisions and strategy.

[TODO] explain Team Topologies approach, the relationship between devs and SREs etc..

### ðŸ¦š Forming a team
Forming a new team is not an easy task. A team needs autonomy, psychological safety and visualization of work. And we have just the right practices for that! 
* Another shout out to DO500 
* Team charter (or social contract) to define how team works 
* Team API to define how team works/collaborate with the other teams
* Team vision and scope, problem the team is trying to solve (prioritization) 
* Mobius loop and summary of practices 
* Reliability Backlog
* After some times, maybe an Empathy Maps to define how SREs are seen by devs
