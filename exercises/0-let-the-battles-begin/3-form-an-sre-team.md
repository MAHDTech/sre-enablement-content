### ðŸŒ± Brand New SRE team!
The company sees this as an opportunity to explore Site Reliability Engineering practices and decides to form a team to provide operational excellence to PetBattle.

Forming a new team is not an easy task. A team needs autonomy, psychological safety and visualization of work. And we have just the right practices for that!

Mobius loop and summary of practices.. 

After some times, maybe an Empathy Maps to define how SREs are seen by devs?
