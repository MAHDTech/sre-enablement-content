## ðŸŒ± Brand New SRE Team!
The company sees this as an opportunity to explore Site Reliability Engineering practices and decides to form a team to provide operational excellence to PetBattle. But it is not just about managing apps in production. SRE practices and SRE mindset can (and will) help the company for future decisions and strategy, discover improvements for the overall system through learning from incidents, turn company into reliablity-aware by enabling others, and more.

[TODO] explain [Team Topologies](https://teamtopologies.com/) approach, the relationship between devs and SREs..

## ðŸ¦š Forming a new team
Forming a new team is not an easy task. A team needs autonomy, psychological safety and visualization of work. And we have just the right practices for that! These practices are not specific for SRE teams but they are helpful to build a good foundation and culture for  Site Reliability Engineering mindset to thrive.
